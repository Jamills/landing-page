                simply
                lotus, is one of two extant species of aquatic plant in the family Nelumbonaceae. It is often
                colloquially called a water lily. Under favorable circumstances the seeds of this aquatic perennial may
                remain viable for many years, with the oldest recorded lotus germination being from that of seeds 1,300
                years old recovered from a dry lakebed in northeastern China.</p>

          <p class="lead">The lotus is often confused with the true water lilies of genus Nymphaea, in particular N.
            caerulea, the "blue lotus".
            In fact, several older systems, such as the Bentham & Hooker system (which is widely used in the Indian
            subcontinent)
            refer to the lotus by its old synonym of Nymphaea nelumbo.

            While all modern plant taxonomy systems agree that this species belongs in the genus Nelumbo, the systems
            disagree as to
            which family Nelumbo should be placed in, or whether the genus should belong in its own unique family and
            order.
            According to the APG IV system, N. nucifera, N. lutea, and their extinct relatives belong in Proteales with
            the protea
            flowers due to genetic comparisons. Older systems, such as the Cronquist system, place N. nucifera and
            its relatives
            in the order Nymphaeles based on anatomical similarities.</p>

          <p class="lead">Tulips (Tulipa) form a genus of spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes
            (having bulbs as storage organs). The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly coloured, generally red,
            pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colours). They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of
            the tepals (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the
            populations, and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip
            is a member of the Liliaceae (lily) family, along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to
            Amana, Erythronium and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae. There are about 75 species, and these are divided among
            four subgenera. The name "tulip" is thought to be derived from a Persian word for turban, which it may have
            been thought to resemble. Tulips originally were found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to Central
            Asia, but since the seventeenth century have become widely naturalised and cultivated (see map). In their
            natural state they are adapted to steppes and mountainous areas with temperate climates. Flowering in the
            spring, they become dormant in the summer once the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a
            shoot from the underground bulb in early spring.</p>

            over in Japan ever since the Meiji period. When the news announces the sakura has started blooming, they use
            Someiyoshino as a standard. Sakura bloom and die fast. The flower petals fall down constantly, making the
            ground of the sakura tree area filled with white or pale pink petals. This feature is often admired and said
            to be the appeal of sakura.</p>
